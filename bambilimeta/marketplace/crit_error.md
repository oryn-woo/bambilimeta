# Handling Django Inline Formset Hidden Fields in Templates

A concise guide to diagnosing and fixing silent failures when using Django inline formsets in custom templates. Learn why hidden fields matter and see exactly how to include them.

---

## Overview

When you render an inline formset in a custom template, it’s easy to forget the hidden inputs that Django uses to track existing instances and delete flags. Omitting these can cause the formset to fail silently—no errors, no saves, just a blank reload.

---

## The Silent Failure Bug

- You submit the formset, but nothing changes.
- No validation errors appear.
- Terminal logs show no formset errors.
- The POST request may even 404 if routed incorrectly.

---

## Root Cause

Django’s inline formsets rely on a **management form** plus per-form **hidden fields**:

1. **Management form**  
   Tracks the total number of forms, initial forms, and deletes.

2. **Hidden `id` fields**  
   Tell Django which existing model instance each form corresponds to.

Without these, Django can’t match your inputs to existing objects, so it never attempts a save.

## Solution: Render All Hidden Fields

Inside your formset loop, render each `hidden_field` before any visible inputs:

```django
{% for img_form in formset %}
  
  {# 1. Render all hidden fields (id, TOTAL_FORMS, etc.) #}
  {% for hidden in img_form.hidden_fields %}
    {{ hidden }}
  {% endfor %}

  {# 2. Then render your visible widgets #}
  <div class="card">
    <!-- thumbnail / preview logic here -->
    {{ img_form.DELETE }}
    {{ img_form.image }}
  </div>
{% endfor %}
